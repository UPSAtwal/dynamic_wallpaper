</br>

This is supposed to be purely a learning project. There probably are far better and user freindly impementations available, use those instead.

Coded in Rust.

TODO:
- Finish it
- For now it uses file extensions to check filetype. Make it usable for image files without any extension.
- Add a gtk4 interface
