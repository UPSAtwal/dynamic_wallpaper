### Dynamic Wallpaper Creator


Dynamic Wallpaper creator for GNOME.

This is supposed to be purely a learning project. There probably are far better and user freindly impementations available, use those instead.

It's not complete either yet, so yeah.

Coded in Rust.

Installation:
```bash
$ ~ git clone https://github.com/jov-1024/dynamic_wallpaper

$ ~ cd dynamic_wallpaper

$ ~ ./install.sh
```

TODO:
- ~~Finish it~~ Done
- For now it uses file extensions to check filetype. Make it usable for image files without any extension.
- Add a gtk4 interface
